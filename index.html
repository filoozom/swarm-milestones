		<h1>Foundation-Wide Tech Goals</h1>
		<p>Swarm Foundation is proud to announce their tech team's shared goals. The aim of these is to create
			predictability in the development tracks and the wider organisation. This should bring more
			peace of mind and tranquility, and give our team the ability to focus, heads down, on the goal in front
			of them.</p>

		<p>With these goals we also hope to inspire the broader ecosystem and community to join in,
			and give a clear outlook to investors.</p>

					<h2>Our own websites on Swarm</h2>
					<p>We upload and can download our own websites (swarm.eth, docs.swarm.eth), through every Swarm
						product (bee, gateway, cli, chrome extension, dashboard/desktop).</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>Measuring success</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>5 MB Zipped file w html, css, js.</li>
								<li>Can be uploaded/downloaded through the gateway, swarm-cli, dashboard/desktop,
									bee-curl</li>
								<li>70% of 5MB website uploads take up-to 2 minutes</li>
								<li>70% of 5mb website downloads take up-to 20 seconds</li>
								<li>The websites can be accessed through a human name w/o doing a blockchain tx for
									every update</li>
							</ul>

						</li> <!-- Measuring success -->

							<h3>Time Estimate</h3>
							<p>21 October 2022 + 3 months</p>
						</li> <!-- Timebox -->
						<li>
							<h3>Value</h3>
							<p>
								Publishers and other organisations have a way to publish information in a non-censorable
								way. This guarantees freedom of information, which is a human right. If we meet this
								goal, data can start flowing through the network which in itself provides us with the
								information needed to test and improve the different software tools.</p>

					<h2>It’s easy and understandable to set up and interact with a Bee node</h2>
					<p>Any crypto enthusiast with an interest in Swarm can set up and run a Bee node easily.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h3>Measuring Success</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Setting up a node (including crypto-onboarding) on Mac, Windows and Linux can be
									done in under 30' in >70% of the cases (both mainnet and testnet).</li>
								<li>User funds are reasonably secure and this is guarenteed by an audit</li>
								<li>There are multiple documented ways of monitoring a Bee node</li>
								<li>Process lifecycle defined and documented</li>
							</ul>
						</li> <!-- Measuring Success -->
						<li>
							<h3>Time Estimate</h3>
							<p>Goal 1 + 2 months</p>
						</li> <!-- Timebox -->
						<li>
							<h3>Value</h3>
							<p>
								If it is trivial to set up a Bee node, more of them will be set up. This will result in
								more node operators, and a stronger network.</p>

				</li> <!-- Goal #2: It’s easy and understandable to set up and interact with a Bee node -->

					<h2>Users can pay to store their data on swarm and node-operators earn BZZ doing this.</h2>
					<p>I can pay to have my content persisted on Swarm. This payment is distributed to node operators
						over time</p>
